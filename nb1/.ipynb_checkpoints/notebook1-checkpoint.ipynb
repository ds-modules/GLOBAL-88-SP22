Functions are also bound, or assigned, to variable names. To use these functions, we need to \"call\" that function through the parentheses syntax: `function_name()`. Adding the parantheses to this function allows us to call it and use its output. Notice that the parantheses must be attached to the function name. That is, the syntax `function_name ()` will result in an error since there is a space between the function name and the parantheses. The values that go inside the parantheses are known as the *function parameters*, on which the function operates on.\n",
