As you can see, the Jupyter notebook supports regular text as well as programming code. Each *cell* or chunk of text can either take on the form of code or regular text.  \n",

To change the cell type from **Code** to **Markdown (Text)**, select the cell and click the dropdown menu (the second rightmost button in the top menu) and change the cell type.\n",

    "Make sure to choose accordingly depending on your different tasks later down the road; cells can only support the type that they were assigned (for example, a **Markdown** type cell will not run code)."
