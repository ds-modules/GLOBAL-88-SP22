    "Welcome! Last week we got an introduction to bar plots and got more experience interpreting line plots. We then generated the same visualizations, partitioned by sex. This week, we will be looking at a non sex-disaggregated dataset. We will be delving deeper into interpreting bar plots and generating a deeper understanding of our data from them. We will look at change throughout time again, and will introduce the word cloud visualization. \n",

    "**Learning Outcomes:**  \n",

    "1. Have a deeper understanding of bar plots.   \n",
    "2. Understand the differences in what analysis we could produce with non sex-disaggregated data.\n",
    "3. Develop a deeper intuition on when and how to use line plots.  \n",
