    "By exploring the following datasets, we hope to get a clearer picture of the magnitude of prison and county jail overcrowding in California per facility and region, and the effects of realignment policies in state prisons and county jails.\n",

    "The key difference between state prisons and jails involve the process of sentencing. Prisons are designed for long term sentences, while jails are for those who are unsentenced or have short term sentences. It is important to note that short-term sentences are generally one year or less. Another difference is that prisons are larger and controlled at the state level. In contrast, jails are smaller and handled by a city or county.\n",
