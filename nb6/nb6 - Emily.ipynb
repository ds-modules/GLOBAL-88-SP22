    "In lecture, we have learned about the policies of realignment, incarceration, and crime trends in the United States. By exploring this dataset we hope to get a clearer picture of the magnitude of prison and county jail overcrowding in California per facility and region, and the effects of realignment policies in state prisons and county jails.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between state prisons and jails involve the process of sentencing. Prisons are designed for long term sentences, while jails are for those who are unsentenced or have short term sentences. It is important to note that short-term sentences are generally one year or less. Another difference is that prisons are larger and controlled at the state level. In contrast, jails are smaller and handled by a city or county.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between the two institutions is emphasized by mass incarceration. Through this notebook, we will analyze how overcrowding within California’s state prisons influenced the size of jail populations after realignment policies were implemented.\n",

This provides a framework with which to understand prison overcrowding and the effectiveness of policy to reduce it. \n",

Given this, to get more insight into our research question, one possible route of analysis might be to calculate the percentage of individuals contained within a prison relative to its capacity (the amount of prisoners they were actually built to hold). \n",

We will select only `year`, `total_population`, and `designed_capacity`. We will call this new table `total_pop_and_design`. We will also group by year and sum both `total_population` and `designed_capacity` for all prisons given a year."
