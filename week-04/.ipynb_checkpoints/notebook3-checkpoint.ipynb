    "Welcome! Last week we got an introduction to data types and the visualizations we can conduct with them. This week, we will expand more on table operations and visualization topics that we introduced in the first and second notebooks. This week, however, we will be dealing with a dataset regarding gender violence accross Colombia. This week we will take a look at a primary, sex-disaggregated dataset. Next week we will look at a secondary, non sex-disaggregated data.  \n",

    "1. Understand what and when bar plots are used.  \n",
    "2. Understand the differences between sex-disaggregated and non sex-disaggregated data\n",
    "3. Understand the insights we can derive from a sex-disaggregated data  \n",

    "They define sex-disaggregated data as data that can be grouped based on sex. Although often labeled as \"Gender\" by many datasets, what is often really expressed is a given individual's birth-assigned sex. [\"Gender\", on the other hand, refers to socially constructed relations between men and women.](https://data2x.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MeasuringWomensFinInclusion-ValueofSexDisaggData.pdf) The importance of sex-disaggregated data relies in its potential to uncover different, unequal experiences between men and women as a result of gender roles and expectations. Although this never tells us the whole picture, it is an important first step in getting there.  \n",
