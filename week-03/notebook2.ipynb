    "Welcome! Last week we got an introduction to Jupyter, Python, and table operations. Specifically, we reviewed the table methods: `show()`, `select()`, and `sort()`. We also looked at the table properties: `tbl.num_columns`, `tbl.num_rows`, and `tbl.labels`. This week we will go over what types of data exist in the world, and what visualizations we can conduct. For this, we will be using the `matplotlib` library. \n",

    "Throughout the course of this notebook you will be using data science techniques and concepts to assess different measures of gender-related violence in India. Data analysis allows us to summarize and understand any trends found in our data. The main purpose of this notebook is to determine any trends in gender-related violence in India found after [the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013](https://www.iitk.ac.in/wc/data/TheCriminalLaw.pdf). Specifically, we'd like to assess whether this legislation had any effect on gender-related violence accross India, and if so, what were those effects?  \n",

    "By the end of this notebook, students will be able to: \n",
    "1. How to work with Jupyter Notebooks and conduct basic data exploration on gender violence on a local case study in India.\n",
    "2. Learn about basic data literacy, including misuse of statistics, intentional and unintentional.\n",
    "3. Learn about ethical challenges and making decision about research efficacy and validity."

    "Our data comes from the [National Crime Records Bureau of India](https://ncrb.gov.in/en) which was set up in 1986 to \"function as a repository of information on crime and criminals so as to assist the investigators in linking crime to the perpetrators.\" For the purpose of this analysis, we deal with two datasets: [one pertaining to crime in cities in India](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/crime_in_india_table_additional_table_chapter_reports/Table%203B.1_3.pdf) and [another pertaining to crime across Indian states/union territories](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/crime_in_india_table_additional_table_chapter_reports/Table%203A.1_0.pdf).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these datasets look at crimes in India between the years of 2017-2019 as well as at specific factors (population, total crime against women) that will be useful in trying to make inferences about gender-based violence in certain areas in India.  \n",
    "\n",

    "*Note: In the Indian numbering system, a ***lakh*** is equal to 100,000. Moreover, politically, a *union territory* is a small administrative unit like a state, but while states are self-governed, union territories are directly ruled over by the central or union government.

More importantly, scatter plots allow us to visualize the concept of **correlation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "When working as data scientists, [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) is one of the most important concepts to grasp. It is used to describe the strength of an association between two variables. So while a scatter plot *shows* us the relationship between two variables, correlation *numerically describes* the strength and direction of that relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important value to understand is the correlation coefficient **r**, which is always a number between -1 and 1. Correlation coefficient values closer to 0 tell us that two variables have no association. On the contrary, correlation coefficient values closer to -1 or 1 tell us that two variables are *highly correlated*, meaning they are both heavily associated with one another. Notice how this does not tell us whether two variables are related by cause an effect. This is because **correlation is not causation**.\n",

    "For the following section, you will see and create a series of scatter plots, and also view their correlation coefficient. [Using the following link as a guide, interpret the correlation coefficients and the scatterplot between two variables for the following questions.](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/correlation-coefficient/)"

We also see a correlation coefficient of $\\approx 0.44$. How do we piece this together? Since our correlation coefficient is positive, literacy rate and GDP exhibit a positive relationship with one another. That is, states with higher GDP are associated with higher literacy rates.

Notice how the sequential variable, `Year`, is plotted on the x-axis, and our other numerical variable, `Number of Crimes` is plotted on the y-axis.
