    "Welcome! Last week we got an introduction to Jupyter, Python, and table operations. Specifically, we reviewed the table methods: `show()`, `select()`, and `sort()`. We also looked at the table properties: `tbl.num_columns`, `tbl.num_rows`, and `tbl.labels`. This week we will go over what types of data exist in the world, and what visualizations we can conduct with each data type. For this, we will be using the `matplotlib` library. \n",

    "\n",
    "Both of these datasets look at crimes in India between the years of 2017-2019 as well as at specific factors (population, total crime against women) that will be useful in trying to make inferences about gender-based violence in certain areas in India.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: In the Indian numbering system, a ***lakh*** is equal to 100,000. Moreover, politically, a *union territory* is a small administrative unit like a state, but while states are self-governed, union territories are directly ruled over by the central or union government.

More importantly, scatter plots allow us to visualize the concept of **correlation**. \n",

Notice how this does not tell us whether two variables are related by cause an effect. This is because **correlation is not causation**.\n",

We hope you gained some insight on how to analyze and interpret crime rate data, particularly how to think about these data under sociopolitical contexts. "
